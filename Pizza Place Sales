In this SQL, I'm querying data from a pizza place for a single year. 

1. Are there any pizzas we should take off the menu? Any bestsellers? 
SELECT pizza_id, sum(quantity) as total_quantity
FROM order_details
GROUP BY pizza_id
ORDER BY total_quantity;

2. What date has the most pizzas sold?
SELECT date,sum(quantity) AS total_quantity
FROM order_details
INNER JOIN orders 
ON order_details.order_id = orders.order_id
GROUP BY DATE
ORDER BY total_quantity DESC;

3. How many pizzas are typically in an order?
SELECT avg(quantity) as avg_quantity
FROM order_details;

4. How many customers do we have each day?
SELECT COUNT(order_id), date
FROM orders
GROUP BY date;

5. Are there any peak hours?
SELECT COUNT(order_id) AS orders, STRFTIME('%H',time) AS hour
FROM orders
GROUP BY hour
ORDER BY COUNT(order_id) DESC;

6. How much money did we make this year?
SELECT strftime('%Y', date) AS year, ROUND(sum(price * quantity),2) AS total
FROM order_details
INNER JOIN pizzas
ON order_details.pizza_id = pizzas.pizza_id
INNER JOIN orders
ON orders.order_id = order_details.order_id
