The data I worked for represents a digital media store and includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers.

1. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.

SELECT c.FirstName, c.LastName, i.InvoiceId, i.InvoiceDate, i.BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices AS i
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers AS c
ON i.CustomerId = c.CustomerId
WHERE i.BillingCountry ="Brazil";

2. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.

SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.Lastname, inv.invoiceid
FROM chinook.employees AS emp
JOIN chinook.customers AS cust
ON emp.Employeeid = cust.SupportRepid
JOIN chinook.Invoices AS inv 
ON inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId

3. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.

SELECT cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, cust.Country, emp.FirstName, emp.LastName, inv.Total
FROM customers AS cust
INNER JOIN invoices AS inv
ON inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId
INNER JOIN employees as emp
ON emp.EmployeeId = cust.SupportRepId 

4. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line item.

SELECT invitems.invoicelineid, tracks.name
FROM Invoice_items AS invitems
INNER JOIN tracks
ON invitems.trackid = tracks.trackid

5. Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.

SELECT t.name AS 'Track Name', a.title AS 'Album Title', m.name AS 'Media Type' , g.name AS 'Genre'
FROM tracks AS t
INNER JOIN albums AS a
ON t.albumid = a.albumid
INNER JOIN media_types AS m
ON t.mediatypeid = m.mediatypeid
INNER JOIN genres AS g
ON t.genreid = g.genreid;

6. Show the total sales made by each sales agent.

SELECT e.firstname, e.lastname, ROUND(SUM(i.total), 2) AS 'Total Sales'
FROM employees AS e
INNER JOIN customers AS c
ON e.employeeid = c.supportrepid
INNER JOIN invoices AS i
ON c.customerid = i.invoiceid
WHERE e.title = 'Sales Support Agent'
GROUP BY e.firstname;


7.Which sales agent made the most in sales in 2009?

SELECT e.firstname, e.lastname, ROUND(SUM(i.total),2) AS 'Total Sales'
FROM employees AS e
INNER JOIN customers AS c
ON e.employeeid = c.supportrepid
INNER JOIN invoices AS i
ON c.customerid = i.invoiceid
WHERE e.title = 'Sales Support Agent' AND i.invoicedate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31'
GROUP BY e.firstname
ORDER BY (round(sum(i.Total), 2)) DESC LIMIT 1;
